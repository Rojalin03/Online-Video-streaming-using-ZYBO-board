# Online-Video-streaming-using-ZYBO-board
It is an embedded project where I had used Verilog HDL and C language for creating the block diagram ,code and interfacing part using Zybo Board for transmitting a video signal from a source to a sink by changing the colored video signal to Gray-scale Video.
I learnt about AMBA bus technologies and basic bus architecture(Master-Slave Relation) and different protocols required for the video signal transmission.
It was a 1month project.
